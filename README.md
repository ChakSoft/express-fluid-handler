## Reference

`Handler(callback, [options])`

| Option | Description
| ------ | -----------
| `callback` | Mandatory callback which returns the result to be sent into the response
| `options` | Optional callbacks applied before or after the main `callback`
| `options.before(req)` | `Function` called just before the `callback` is called. It takes the request object in first and only argument. This function **MUST** return the request object.
| `options.after(req, result)` | `Function` called just after the `callback` has been called. It takes the request object and the result of the `callback` as arguments. This function **MUST** return the result.
| `options.preventGlobal` | `Boolean` which determines if the given handler execution must avoid global `before` and `after` callbacks. Local callbacks are executed only with this option to `true`.

`Handler.addBefore(callback)`

Adds a global before callback, which is applied before `options.before` callback. You can add as many *before* callbacks as you want, but ensure they all returns the request object.

Ì€`Handler.addAfter(callback)`

Adds a global after callback, which is applied just before the result is sent into the Express response object. You can add as many *after* callbacks as you want, but ensure they all returns the result.

> Whatever they are before or after callbacks, they are executed in the exact same order as they have been added.
